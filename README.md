Project Name: 10 Things I hate About Aybu
“10 Things I Hate About Aybu” Ceng311 Sprint Project
1) In my project Aybu, I have a page where students can submit their complaints about the school. I have 6 pages:

Home,
o There are ten buttons on this page and it offers complaints about different topics. When the buttons are clicked, it sends ajax request to json files (education.json, transport.json,meals.json..) and offers suggestions according to the button title.

Complete,
o This screen is designed to receive complaints from users.

Feedbacks,
o This screen is designed to see the result of users' complaints.

About Us,
o This screen is used to inform users about us.

Contact Us,
o This screen is designed for users to communicate with us. On this screen, I added the validation rules , the help button, date picker, guess inputs. (3 jQuery plugins and 1 jQuery-UI widget.)

Support.
o This screen is designed so that users can forward their complaints to the relevant departments. The contact information of the relevant units was retrieved from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users with an ajax request. Here, acordion jQuery-UI widget structure and contact information according to units are specified.
2) I think the project has a concept that appeals to users. It has both a fun and critical interface. After that, it can be made available by making it a more interactive page with the user.
